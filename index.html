          <h3>Super Mom</h3>
          <p> I am a mom of a 5-year-old boy and this 24/7 job is my favorite one! My son Emir is an amazing kid, he loves to wear superhero costumes and to jump and run all the time while screaming. To be honest, he is the only person I ever met that can make me tired. Not that I'm not in good shape - I was dancer for almost 30 years which means sometimes I had to dance 10+ hours per day. I just think that he is the mini-me version and now I finally can understand my mother. </p>

          <h3>Solutions Engineer</h3>
          <p> Today I am working as an Engineer and you would think that I was good in science and math during my school days. O no, I was terrible in both math and computer science. I would break something every time I sat down at my computer and I didn't even pass one math quarter exam in high school. I chose to improve my skills and ended up with diploma in Electrical Engineering. Today I'm in love with math and like to teach kids who hate it like I did. All my students passed their exams and actually started to love math. Also, I am installing production systems and helping customers to find an optimal technical solution for their business.
